## 🧹 Code Quality & Git Hooks

This project uses **Husky**, **lint-staged**, and **commitlint** to enforce code quality and commit message standards.

### What Runs Automatically

- **pre-commit**
  - Runs ESLint with auto-fix
  - Runs Prettier formatting
  - Blocks commits if checks fail

- **commit-msg**
  - Validates commit messages using Commitlint
  - Enforces Conventional Commits format
  - Blocks commits with invalid commit messages

This setup helps maintain consistent code style and a clean, readable git history.

---

### Local Setup

Git hooks are enabled automatically after installing dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

If hooks do not run for any reason, re-enable Husky manually:

```bash
pnpm exec husky install
```

---

### Configuration Overview

#### pre-commit hook

```sh
pnpm exec lint-staged
```

#### commit-msg hook

```sh
pnpm exec commitlint --edit $1
```

#### lint-staged configuration

```json
{
  "**/*.{ts,tsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"]
}
```

#### commitlint configuration

Commit messages must follow the **Conventional Commits** specification.

Examples of valid commit messages:

```text
feat: add cross-chain swap workflow
fix: handle null wallet address
chore: update dependencies
docs: update README
```

---

### Skipping Hooks (Not Recommended)

Hooks can be skipped in exceptional cases:

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

> ⚠️ Use sparingly. CI checks will still run and invalid commits may be rejected.

---

## Workflow System

The agent uses an intelligent workflow system that:

- **Parses Intent:** Understands natural language commands
- **Plans Workflow:** Creates step-by-step execution plans
- **Executes Tools:** Runs appropriate tools in sequence
- **Manages State:** Tracks operation status and results
- **Provides Feedback:** Returns structured responses
