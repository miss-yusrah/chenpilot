/**
 * Bug Condition Exploration Test for Admin IP Whitelist Enforcement
 *
 * **Validates: Requirements 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2**
 *
 * CRITICAL: This test MUST FAIL on unfixed code - failure confirms the bug exists
 *
 * This test directly tests the route configuration to verify if IP whitelist middleware
 * is applied to admin routes. On UNFIXED code, the middleware will NOT be present.
 * After the fix is implemented, the middleware will be present.
 *
 * DO NOT attempt to fix the test or the code when it fails - the failure is expected
 * and proves the bug exists.

   * - requireAdminWithIpWhitelist is NOT applied to /admin/stats route
   * - Only authenticateToken and requireAdmin are present in the middleware chain

   * This proves that the IP whitelist middleware exists but is not being used,

   * - requireAdminWithIpWhitelist WILL be imported
   * - requireAdminWithIpWhitelist WILL be in the middleware chain for /admin/stats
